# slim-accretion-disk-TDE
Code for my undergraduate thesis: Tidal disruption events with Super-Eddington accretion disk around blackholes.

My first project written in Python, poorly maintainable code, but hopefully someone find it useful. 

## Abstract
At the beginning of the tidal disruption, the fallback rate of debris can be very high, and then the fallback rate will decrease with time, following t^(-5/3). Thus, based on the known accretion rate (fallback rate) we can calculate the evolution of luminosity over time throughout the tidal disruption event. However, since the initial accretion rate of the tidal disruption event is much larger than the Eddington accretion rate, the slim accretion disk model is needed for calculation. In this work, I first simulated the tidal disruption process, in which the star fell into the black hole gravitational field. Later, I theoretically calculated the evolution of luminosity over time in the tidal disruption event, and found that the evolution of luminosity doesn’t follow t^(-5/3), the luminosity of other frequency bands do not follow this rule as well.
